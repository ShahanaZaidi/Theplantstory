    <h1>Outdoor Plants</h1>
    <p>There is increasing evidence that exposure to plants and green space, and particularly to gardening, is beneficial to mental and physical health.Spending time in nature gives people an increased feeling of vitality, increasing their energy levels and making them feel more animated. Their performance levels are, in turn, increased by this improved state of mind. Natural environments induce a positive outlook on life, making people feel more alive and active. When people experience increased vigor, they put more of themselves and their energy into their work. Plants can help people to improve their performance at work and at home by increasing their perceived vitality and giving them more feelings of added energy.</p>

    <h2 id="begonias">1. Begonias</h2>
    <img src="./images/begonia2.jpg" alt="Begonias">
    <p class="description">Begonias are becoming more popular with plant breeders and many varieties make excellent indoor foliage plants. In particular, rex begonias, with their unusual colors, patterns, and textures, will make nice houseplants. They can be difficult to grow indoors​ because they prefer high humidity, but growing them on a pebble tray helps.</p>
    <h2 id="rose">2. Rose</h2>
    <img src="./images/rose1.jpg" alt="Rose">
    <p class="description">Roses are lovely and romantic in any garden setting, whether you have a tiny urban plot or a large, country back yard. And they’re not as picky as you think! Many new types have been bred to be long-blooming and more resistant to diseases, and they don’t need to be deadheaded, or have spent blooms removed so they keep flowering. Stick with a shrub or landscape rose for your first attempt because they require almost zero care.</p>
    <h2 id="hydrangea">3. Hydrangea</h2>
    <img src="./images/hydrangea1.jpg" alt="Hydrangea">
    <p class="description">Hydrangeas are just about perfect: With hundreds of different varieties, they thrive in almost any climate. The lacy blooms emerge in early summer and last to fall, and they stay intact on the shrub to provide winter interest. One common misconception: That you can change bloom color on any hydrangea. The truth is only certain types—some big-leaf and mountain hydrangeas—change color based on the presence of aluminum in the soil. Hydrangeas range in height from a few feet tall to 7 or 8 feet tall and wide, so read the label before planting so it has plenty of room to spread.</p>
    <h2 id="herb">4. Herb</h2>
    <img src="./images/herb1.jpg" alt="Herb">
    <p class="description">Herbs are super-easy to grow, and their flowers attract tons of pollinators. It’s also far less expensive to grow them than to buy those plastic containers in the grocery store! Many herbs, such as thyme, sage, and oregano, are perennial, which means they come back every year, while you’ll need to replant basil, cilantro, and summer savory each spring.</p>
    <h2 id="petunias">5. Petunias</h2>
    <img src="./images/petunia1.jpeg" alt="Petunias">
    <p class="description">Petunias bloom spring to frost in a seemingly limitless range of colors: light lemon yellow, lime green, pink, purple, and more. Almost all varieties of this annual are self-cleaning (no deadheading required) for carefree color. For optimal performance, water and fertilize regularly.</p>
    <h2 id="daylilies">6. Daylilies</h2>
    <img src="./images/daylilies1.jpg" alt="Daylilies">
    <p class="description">Daylillies' delicate beauty contradicts their robust nature—you'll often find them grown in ditches or fields. There are dozens of varieties with different colors, patterns, and heights. You'll enjoy these perennials for years to come.</p>
    <h2 id="coleus">7. Coleus</h2>
    <img src="./images/coleus1.jpg" alt="Coleus">
    <p class="description">Another plant that thrives in shade is coleus. You'll want to plant a few of these annuals to have a variety of foliage—from plain green to wild reds. Bring the plants indoors during winter to enjoy as a colorful houseplant</p>
    <h2 id="verbena">8. Verbena</h2>
    <img src="./images/verbena1.jpg" alt="Verbena">
    <p class="description">Get the most out of your flowers by planting verbena—you get height and color out of these summer plants. Clusters of verbena blooms typically come in white, pink, or purple; they make a great accent plant. The ‘Imagination,’ one of the perennial varieties, stands out for its ability to survive in the hottest, driest conditions.</p>
    <h2 id="hostas">9. Hostas</h2>
    <img src="./images/hostas1.jpg" alt="Hostas">
    <p class="description">Hostas can be one of the easiest perennials to grow—as long as deer and slugs don't frequent your garden. (Natural repellents are available if you love hostas and have these unwelcome visitors.) Varieties range from tolerating dappled sun to tolerating part sun, such as ‘Liberty’ hosta. Colors range from pure green to yellow-green variegation to blue-gray and beyond.</p>
    <h2 id="sedums">10. Sedums</h2>
    <img src="./images/sedum1.jpg" alt="Sedums">
    <p class="description">A versatile group of plants, sedums range from short groundcovers to midsize clumping plants. Once these perennials are planted, they require little care—simply water if they look dry and cut back plants after flowering to maintain their shape.</p>
