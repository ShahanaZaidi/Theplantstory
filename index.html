    <h1>Plants</h1>
    <p>The relationship between plants and people is a long and continuous one. We need plants for basic human purposes. We eat them in many forms; we make medicines, soaps, furniture, textiles, tyres and much more from them. Plants play a very important role in our lives. Although we now live in a highly industrialised society, we have not lost this dependence on plants. We need to be aware of the part that plants play in our lives and must ensure that we care for these plants to continue this long relationship.  <br> Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe.</p>

    <p>Every green plant on the planet has an important function: they suck in carbon dioxide and transform it into oxygen. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change and global warming. Plants provide us with food, fiber, shelter, medicine, and fuel. The basic food for all organisms is
        produced by green plants. In the process of food production, oxygen is released. This oxygen, which we
        obtain from the air we breathe, is essential to life. The only source of food and oxygen are plants; no
        animal alone can supply these. Shelter, in the form of wood for houses; and clothing, in the form of
        cotton fibers, are obvious uses of plant materials. But we must not forget fuel, furniture, paper
        products, certain medicines like aspirin, and many other products like perfume and chewing gum. To
        these tangible aspects of the plant world we must also add the importance of beauty and relaxation
        derived from plants. Since animals are surrounded by and dependent upon plants, the factors that
        influence plant growth, structure, and distribution, affect the animal world as well. </p>
