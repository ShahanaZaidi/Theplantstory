    <h1>Hanging Plants</h1>
    <p>Interior design may not be everyoneâ€™s strong suit, but even the newest decorator can use a simple trick to create an atmosphere: indoor plants. Unlike choosing artwork or accent furniture, plants have an effortless way of creating dimension, style, and permanence in a home and many species even clean the air.</p>

    <h2 id="devil">1. Devil's Ivy</h2>
    <img src="./images/hangingdevil2.jpg" alt="hanging ivy">
    <p class="description">A robust climber or hanging plant that is full of drama and of fables. An evergreen vine that can grow over one metre tall and scrambles by way of aerial roots which stick to surfaces. The leaves are variegated green and yellow and are alternate and heart-shaped. It thrives in bright, indirect sunlight but will also tolerate low light conditions. Because of its hardiness and low maintenance, it's a popular plant for beginner gardeners.</p>

    <h2 id="spider">2. Spider Plant</h2>
    <img src="./images/hangingspider1.jpg" alt="hanging spider plant">
    <p class="description">A clumping houseplant with striped foliage in cream and green and white flowers on long stems. This plant produces spider like plantlets at the end of long, arching flower stems. It is a hardy pot specimen for indoors, patios and ferneries. It is not recommended for planting in your garden beds, as it can spread quickly. Keep this plant moist during the warmer months and drier through winter.</p>

    <h2 id="string">3. String Of Banana's</h2>
    <img src="./images/hangingstring2.jpg" alt="hanging string of banana's">
    <p class="description">This popular trailing succulent has leaves that are shaped like bananas or fish hooks and if grown in the ground instead of in a hanging garden, 'String of Bananas' can trail along the ground.</p>

    <h2 id="fern">4. Boston Fern</h2>
    <img src="./images/hangingfern1.jpg" alt="hanging Fern">
    <p class="description">An elegant fern with deeply divided, spreading bright-green fronds, decorated with tiny leaves and a fantastic fountain-like display. Ideal for hanging baskets where it can show-off its dropping habit, indoor containers, patios and verandahs. It prefers a protected spot inside with filtered light and a moist, shaded position outdoors. Easy to care for and maintain Boston ferns are more drought tolerant than other ferns.</p>
    
    <h2 id="heartleaf">5. Heartleaf Philodendron</h2>
    <img src="./images/hangingheart1.jpg" alt="hanging Heartleaf Philodendron">
    <p class="description">An evergreen vine that can grow over one metre tall and scrambles by way of aerial roots which stick to surfaces. The leaves are green and heart-shaped. It thrives in bright, indirect sunlight but will also tolerate low light conditions. Because of its hardiness and low maintenance, it's a popular plant for beginner gardeners.</p>
