    <h1>Indoor Plants</h1>
    <p>Indoor plants are always in fashion. In many ways, they offer the best of both worlds: the joys of gardening, without most of the hard work. As such, the question isn’t ‘should I get an indoor plant?’, but rather, ‘what are the best indoor plants for me?’ Luckily, there are awesome indoor plants to suit almost anyone’s needs.Even if your home is lacking in square footage, incorporating some greenery here and there is essential to bringing it to life. Naturally, indoor plants add more beauty to a space while also providing functional benefits, like promoting a positive mood, purifying the air, and making you feel connected to nature without having to step outside. So there is no reason to let a small space or lack of gardening experience stop you from flexing your green thumb inside your home!</p>

The showy part of the flower features a white, hoodlike sheath (known as a spathe) which resembles a white flag of surrender.</p>
